        MPB is a free and open-source software package for computing the band
        structures, or dispersion relations, and electromagnetic modes of
        periodic dielectric structures, on both serial and parallel computers.
        MPB is an acronym for MIT Photonic Bands. MPB computes
        definite-frequency eigenstates, or harmonic modes, of Maxwell's
        equations in periodic dielectric structures for arbitrary wavevectors,
        using fully-vectorial and three-dimensional methods. It is applicable to
        many problems in optics, such as waveguides and resonator systems, and
        photonic crystals.
