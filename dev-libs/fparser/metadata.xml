        This C++ library offers a class which can be used to parse and evaluate
        a mathematical function from a string (which might be eg. requested from
        the user). The syntax of the function string is similar to mathematical
        expressions written in C/C++ (the exact syntax is specified in the
        documentation below). The function can then be evaluated with different
        values of variables.

        For example, a function like "sin(sqrt(x*x+y*y))" can be parsed from a
        string (either std::string or a C-style string) and then evaluated with
        different values of x and y. This library can be useful for evaluating
        user-inputted functions, or in some cases interpreting mathematical
        expressions in a scripting language.

        This library aims for maximum speed in both parsing and evaluation,
        while keeping maximum portability. The library should compile and work
        with any standard-conforming C++ compiler.

        Different numerical types are supported: double, float, long double,
        long int, std::complex (of types double, float and long double),
        multiple-precision floating point numbers using the MPFR library, and
        arbitrary precision integers using the GMP library. (Note that it's not
        necessary for these two libraries to exist in the system in order to use
        the Function Parser library with the other numerical types. Support for
        these libraries is optionally compiled in using preprocessor settings.)

        This Library is distributed under the Lesser General Public License
        (LGPL) version 3.
