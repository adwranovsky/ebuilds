        Meep implements the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for
        computational electromagnetics. This is a widely used technique in which
        space is divided into a discrete grid and the fields are evolved in time
        using discrete time steps â€” as the grid and the time steps are made
        finer and finer, this becomes a closer and closer approximation for the
        true continuous equations, and one can simulate many practical problems
        essentially exactly.
