	Nextpnr is a placement, routing, and bitstream generation tool that together with Yosys forms a free and open source
	software architecture-neutral FPGA framework. Currently, this flow supports two commercially available FPGA
	families, Lattice iCE40 (up to 8K logic elements) and Lattice ECP5 (up to 85K elements) and has been
	hardware-proven for custom-computing machines including a low-power neural-network accelerator and an Open- RISC
	system-on-chip capable of booting Linux. Both Yosys and nextpnr have been engineered in a highly flexible manner
	to support many of the features present in modern FPGAs by separating architecture-specific details from the
	common mapping algorithms. This framework is demonstrated on a longest-path case study to find an atypical
	single source-sink path occupying up to 45% of all on-chip wiring
